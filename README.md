# ML-Classification-Methods
The goal of this project is to build a tree leaf classifier using a probabilistic approach initially, and then using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a second phase. 

To simplify, we will first focus on a 4-class problem (''pimento'', ''papaya'', ''chrysanthemum'', ''chocolate tree''), and then progressively enrich the classifier with a database containing 32 different types of leaves.

To achieve this, we will use three methods: 
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Convolutional neural networks
